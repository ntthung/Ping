To use this repo

* Download or clone it to your computer
* Open the file Ping.Rproj. This will set up the project environments so that the code can be run conveniently. 
* Open the file `Rmd/Ping.Rmd`, which contains all the code. If you're using a sufficiently recent version of RStudio, it will suggest you to install the required packages. Otherwise you can install the packages manually along the way.
* You can run the code chunks step by step, or knit the document to see the code and output together in the output HTML file.
